Wine lets us run Windows software on other operating systems.
With Wine, we can install and run these applications just like we do in Windows.

Installation Steps for Wine in ubuntu:
1.sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa
2.sudo apt-get update
3.sudo apt-get install wine
4.sudo apt-get install winetricks


To use wine,we need to configure first using following command on terminal:
winecfg

The WINE configuration window will pop up. Click OK to close the window. You can now find a .wine folder in your Home directory (if you can’t see it, go to View and check “Show Hidden Files“).
