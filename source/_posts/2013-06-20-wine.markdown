Wine lets us run Windows software on other operating systems.
With Wine, we can install and run these applications just like we do in Windows.

<h2>Installation Steps for Wine in ubuntu:</h2>

[1]
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa
[2]
        sudo apt-get update
[3]
        sudo apt-get install wine
[4]
        sudo apt-get install winetricks

	

To use wine,we need to configure first using following command on terminal:
        winecfg

The WINE configuration window will pop up. Click OK to close the window. You can now find a .wine folder in your Home directory (if you can’t see it, go to View and check “Show Hidden Files“).

<h2>ISTALLING APPLICATION using wine:</h2>

        1.Download the Windows application you wish to install and 
          place it in a convenient directory.
        2.Open the terminal on your system.
        3.Change to the directory where the application 
          installer is located.
        4.Issue the command wine followed by the name of 
          the application to install it.
          e.g: wine applicationname.exe
