First we need a web server to host our PHP pages.so we are first installing Apache2.

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install apache2
Now,to test that Apache is working properly,try on ur browser:
http://localhost/

There will be a message displayed with "IT WORKS!..."

Now,to install PHP use following command on terminal:

        sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5
When this is done you are ready.

Letâ€™s go and delete the default page of Apache so we can create our own.

Open a terminal and type:

        sudo rm /var/www/index.html
If you want to test that PHP is installed successfully into your system you can write and run a simple PHP script that will return to you the PHP information. So open the terminal and type:

        sudo gedit /var/www/index.php

This will open an empty document where we can write our PHP code.
Next,Restart the web-server by typing:
        sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

And point your web browser at: http://localhost/

You should now be able to see your first PHP page running.
